<p>Luffy's primary goal is to become the Pirate King, but his true,
   deeper dream is to create a world where people are free and do not go hungry. 
   This dream was revealed to be similar to the one shared by Gol D. Roger,
    the previous Pirate King, and involves a fundamental shift in the world's societal structure. 
    While the exact details are still a mystery, the dream is said to be simple, wonderful,
     and a source of strong emotion for those who hear it. </p>
